## Hello ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ“¢ **I'm actively looking for research positions in academia or industry starting in April 2026.**
**Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research.**

I am Ryuto, a final-year PhD student (est. March 2026) at the [Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en), advised by Prof. [Naoaki Okazaki](https://www.chokkan.org/index.en.html).
During my PhD, I have engaged in multiple research projects with Prof. [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/) at [Penn NLP](https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/) and Prof. [Preslav Nakov](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/preslav-nakov/) at [MBZUAI NLP](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research-department/natural-language-processing-department/). In addition to my PhD research, I am involved as a research advisor for a [startup](https://3keigo.com/) on multi-lingual text generation.

I am passionate about making AI systems actually work in the real world, with my primary research focus on **Responsible AI**. My work includes model **robustness**, the creation of **interpretable** NLP systems, ensuring **the safe application** of LLMs, and **rigorous evaluation** grounded in the wild.
Particularly, my research on detecting AI-generated text has gathered notable attention with coverage in the Nikkei, received conference awards, and collectively has over 100 citations.

Topics: Responsible AI, Robustness, Interpretability, AI Text Detection, Membership Inference, LLM-as-a-judge
