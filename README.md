## Hello ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ“¢ **I am on the job market for 2026! Please reach out if you think my background and experience may be a good fit for your organization.**


Hello! I am Ryuto, a final-year PhD student (est. March 2026) at the [Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en), advised by Prof. [Naoaki Okazaki](https://www.chokkan.org/index.en.html). 
My research aims to develop principles and methods for building and ensuring safe, secure, and reliable AI systems, mitigating their negaitve societal implications. 
My current work focuses on membership inference attacks, AI-generated text detection, jailbreak defense, and reliable LLM-as-a-judge. My work has been published in top-tier conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, and AAAI, and I have led multiple collaborative projects with Prof. [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/) and Prof. [Preslav Nakov](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/preslav-nakov/). Particularly, my research on detecting AI-generated text has gathered notable attention with coverage in the Nikkei, received conference awards, and collectively has over 100 citations.
