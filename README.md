## Hello ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ“¢ **Actively looking for full-time industry researcher positions starting in April 2026.**

I am Ryuto, a final-year PhD student (est. March 2026) at the [Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en), advised by Prof. [Naoaki Okazaki](https://www.chokkan.org/index.en.html).
During my PhD, I have engaged in multiple collaborative research with leading scholars in NLP, including Prof. [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/) at [Penn NLP](https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/) (as a visiting student) and Prof. [Preslav Nakov](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/preslav-nakov/) at [MBZUAI NLP](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research-department/natural-language-processing-department/) (remote). In addition to my PhD research, I am involved as an advisor for a [startup](https://3keigo.com/) on multi-lingual text generation.

My research focuses on the automated detection of AI-generated content. Particularly, I am interested in how to build deployable AI detectors in real-world scenarios with minimum harm. Besides detection, I have also worked on improving the reliability of LLM-as-a-judge in text evaluation. My previous work has included:

- ðŸ’ª Robustness. Against adversarial attacks (e.g., paraphrasing) [[AAAI'24]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11729) and distributional shifts via prompt variation in the wild [[EMNLP'24 Findings]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08369)
- ðŸ‘€ Interpretability. Presenting similar examples as detection evidence [[In submission]](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11336); NLP experts might actually detect AI-generated texts with some clues [[In submission]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11614)
- ðŸ“Š Evaluation. More reliable LLM-as-a-judge [[ACL'24 Findings]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15987)

I am also interested in applying AI detection to other domains: training-set filtering, content moderation, writing improvement, etc.
