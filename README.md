## Hello ðŸ‘‹
I am Ryuto, a CS PhD candidate at the [Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en) (Formerly Tokyo Tech), advised by [Naoaki Okazaki](https://www.chokkan.org/index.en.html). My expected graduation date is March 2026. Currently, I am visiting the [UPenn NLP](https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/), hosted by [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/). I also work with [Preslav Nakov](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/preslav-nakov/) from [MBZUAI NLP](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research-department/natural-language-processing-department/).

I work on AI safety, specifically improving the safety of large language models (LLMs) from various perspectives, including:
- **Machine-generated Text Detection**
  - **Robustness** against adversarial attacks in the wild, on a method [OUTFOX (AAAI 2024)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11729) and an evaluation [Prompt Variation (EMNLP 2024 Findings)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08369).
  - **Human interpretability** of the detection results [ExaGPT (ACL 2025 In submission)](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11336)
- **LLM-as-a-judge**, particularly towards a **reliable evaluation** [Self-Preference Bias (ACL 2024 Findings)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15987).
- LLM Memorization, Jailbreak, and Safe Alignment (TBD)

ðŸ“¢ **I am actively looking for research internships starting in (Summer | Fall | Winter) 2025.**
