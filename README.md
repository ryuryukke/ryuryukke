## Hello ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ“¢ **Actively looking for full-time researcher positions starting in April 2026.**

I am Ryuto, a final-year PhD student (est. March 2026) at the [Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en), advised by Prof. [Naoaki Okazaki](https://www.chokkan.org/index.en.html).
During my PhD, I have engaged in multiple research projects with leading scholars in NLP, including Prof. [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/) at [Penn NLP](https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/) (as a visiting student) and Prof. [Preslav Nakov](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/preslav-nakov/) at [MBZUAI NLP](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research-department/natural-language-processing-department/) (remote). In addition to my PhD research, I am involved as an advisor for a [startup](https://3keigo.com/) on multi-lingual text generation.

I am passionate about **making AI systems actually work in the real world**, with particular interests in AI safety, Robustness, Interpretability, and Evaluation. My current research focuses on the automated detection of AIâ€‘generated content, specifically on building deployable detectors in practical scenarios with minimum harm. Besides detection, I have also worked on improving the reliability of LLM-as-a-judge in text evaluation:
- ðŸ’ª **Robustness.** Proposed OUTFOX, a detection framework against adversarial attacks [[AAAI'24]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11729). Found a vulnerability against distributional shifts via prompt variation in the wild [[EMNLP'24 Findings]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.08369).
- ðŸ‘€ **Interpretability.** Proposed an interpretable detector that can present similar examples as evidence [[In submission]](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11336). Found that NLP experts can detect AI-generated texts with some clues [[In submission]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11614).
- ðŸ“Š **Evaluation.** Improved LLM-as-a-judge by mitigating self-preference bias [[ACL'24 Findings]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.15987).
