## Hello ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ“¢ **I'm actively looking for research positions in academia or industry starting in April 2026.**
**Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research.**


Hello! I am Ryuto, a final-year PhD student (est. March 2026) at the [Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.isct.ac.jp/en), advised by Prof. [Naoaki Okazaki](https://www.chokkan.org/index.en.html). 
My research aims to develop principles and methods for building and ensuring safe, secure, and reliable AI systems. 
My current work focuses on membership inference attacks, AI-generated text detection, jailbreak defense, and reliable LLM-as-a-judge. My work has been published in leading conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, and AAAI.
I have led multiple research projects with Prof. [Chris Callison-Burch](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ccb/) at [Penn NLP](https://nlp.cis.upenn.edu/) and Prof. [Preslav Nakov](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/preslav-nakov/) at [MBZUAI NLP](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/research-department/natural-language-processing-department/). Particularly, my research on detecting AI-generated text has gathered notable attention with coverage in the Nikkei, received conference awards, and collectively has over 100 citations.
